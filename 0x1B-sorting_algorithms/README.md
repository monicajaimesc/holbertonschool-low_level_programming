# Sorting algorithms & Big O

## 

### Description

In computer science, a sorting algorithm is an algorithm that puts elements of a list in a certain order. Efficient sorting is important for optimizing the efficiency of other algorithms (such as search and merge algorithms) that require input data to be in sorted lists
